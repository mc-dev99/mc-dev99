### Hi there 👋

I'm Mica (she/hers), full-stack software engineer! I'm a graduate of the [Ada Developers Academy](adadevelopersacademy.org). You can find me honing my skills, reading science fiction and fantasy, and dreaming up computer miscellany.

🌱 I’m currently learning Go, Terraform, Kubernetes and AWS to strengthen my cloud developer skills, and Rust just for kicks.
💬 Ask me about video game ludonarrative, experimental rock and electronic, console homebrew, and SFF fiction recommendations
📫 Reach me at: mica.c.dev@gmail.com, or at linkedin/in/micac18
